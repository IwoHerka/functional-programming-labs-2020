; I. Using the REPL to experiment ----------------------------------------------

; Most software development projects include a stage where you're not sure what
; needs to happen next. Perhaps you need to use a library or part of a library
; you've never touched before. Or perhaps you know what your input to a
; particular function will be, and what the output should be, but you aren't
; sure how to get from one to the other. In some programming languages, this can
; be time-consuming and frustrating; but by using the power of the Clojure REPL,
; the interactive command prompt, it can be fun.

; Say someone suggests to you that coloring every pixel of a canvas with the xor
; of its x and y coordinates might produce an interesting image. It shouldn't be
; too hard, so you can jump right in. You'll need to perform an operation on
; every x and y in a pair of ranges. Do you know how range works?
(range 5)
; => (0 1 2 3 4)

; That should do nicely for one coordinate. To nest seqs, for often does the
; trick. But again, rather than writing code and waiting until you have enough
; to warrant compiling and testing, you can try it:
(for [x (range 2) y (range 2)] [x y])
; => ([0 0] [0 1] [1 0] [1 1])

; There are the coordinates that will form your input. Now you need to xor them:
(xor 0 2)
; => CompilerException java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to resolve symbol: xor
; in this context

; Bother -- no function named xor. Fortunately, Clojure provides find-doc, which
; searches not just function names but also their doc strings for the given
; term:
(find-doc "xor")
; clojure.core/bit-xor
; ([x y] [x y & more])
; Bitwise exclusive or
; => nil

; So the function you need is called bit-xor:
(bit-xor 1 2)
; => 3

; Perfect! Next you want to adjust the earlier for form to return bit-xor along
; with x and y. The easiest way to do this depends on what tool is hosting your
; REPL. In many, you can press the up-arrow key on your keyboard a couple of
; times to bring back the earlier for form. You won't want to retype things to
; make minor adjustments, so take a moment right now to figure out a method you
; like that will let you make a tweak like this by inserting the bit-xor call:
(for [x (range 2) y (range 2)]
  [x y (bit-xor x y)])
; => ([0 0 0] [0 1 1] [1 0 1] [1 1 0])

; That looks about right. We're about to shift gears to pursue the graphics side
; of this problem, so tuck away that bit of code in a function so it'll be easy
; to use later:
(defn xors [max-x max-y]
  (for [x (range max-x) y (range max-y)]
    [x y (bit-xor x y)]))

(xors 2 2)
; => ([0 0 0] [0 1 1] [1 0 1] [1 1 0])

; You might even save that into a .clj file, if you haven't already. It's worth
; mentioning that saving files with the .clj extension is standard for Clojure
; source code, whereas .cljs is standard for ClojureScript files.

; Clojure's REPL isn't just for playing around; it's also great for
; experimenting with Java libraries. We believe there's no better environment
; for exploring a Java API than Clojure's REPL. To illustrate, poke around with
; java.awt, starting with a Frame:
(def frame (java.awt.Frame.))
; => #'user/frame

; That should have created a Frame, but no window appeared. Did it work at all?
frame
; => #<Frame java.awt.Frame[frame0,0,22,0x0,invalid,hidden,layout=java.awt.BorderLayout,title=,resizable,normal]>

; Well, you have a Frame object, but perhaps the reason you can't see it is
; hinted at by the word hidden in the #<Frame...> printout. Perhaps the Frame
; has a method you need to call to make it visible. One way to find out would be
; to check the Javadoc of the object, but because you're at the REPL already,
; let's try something else. You've already seen how the for macro works, so
; maybe you can check a class for which methods it has to see whether one you
; can use is available:

(defn methods [class]
  (for [meth (.getMethods class)     ; Iterater over class methods
        :let [name (.getName meth)]  ; Bind a variable name
        :when (re-find #"Visible" name)] ; Build a seq of matched names
    name))

(methods java.awt.Frame)
; => ("setVisible" "isVisible")

; The for macro provides a way to iterate over a collection, performing some
; action on each item and collecting the results into a sequence. The preceding
; example iterates over a sequence of the methods available on the
; java.awt.Frame class. Whenever Clojure encounters a symbol that looks like a
; Java class name, it attempts to resolve it as a class. This behavior allows
; you to then call the getMethods method directly on the class. Next, a :let
; flag and bindings vector is used, working similarly to the let special form
; that you use to bind the local method-name to the result of calling the method
; .getName on each method in turn. The :when is used to limit the elements used
; in its body to only those that return a truthy value in the expression after
; the directive. Using these directives lets you iterate through the methods and
; build a seq of those whose names match a regular expression #"Vis".

; Your query returns two potential methods, so try each of them:
(.isVisible frame)
; => false

; That's false, as you might have suspected. Will setting it to true make any
; difference?
(.setVisible frame true)
; => nil

; It did, but it's so tiny! Not to worry, because a Frame class also has a
; .setSize method you can use:
(.setSize frame (java.awt.Dimension. 400 400))
; => nil

; And up pops a blank window for you to draw on. At this point, we'll guide you
; through the rest of this section; but keep in mind that Java's official API
; might be of interest, should you choose to extend the example program.

; NOTE The Clojure clojure.java.javadoc namespace has a javadoc function to
; query and view official API documentation: (javadoc frame). This should return
; a string corresponding to a URL and open a browser window for the right page
; of documentation. Prior to Clojure 1.2, this function was in
; clojure.contrib.repl-utils.

; What you need to draw into your Frame is its graphics context, which can be
; fetched as shown:
(def gfx (.getGraphics frame))
; => #'user/gfx

; Then, to draw, you can try out the fillRect method of that graphics context.
; If you're trying this yourself, make sure the blank window is positioned so
; that it's unobscured while you're typing into your REPL:
(.fillRect gfx 100 100 50 75)

; And just like that, you're drawing on the screen interactively. You should
; see a single black rectangle in the formerly empty window. Exciting, isn't
; it? You could be a kid playing with turtle graphics for the first time, it's
; so much fun. But what it needs is a dash of color:
(.setColor gfx (java.awt.Color. 255 128 0))
(.fillRect gfx 100 150 75 50)

; Now there should be an orange rectangle as well. Perhaps the coloring would
; make Martha Stewart cry, but you've tried all the basic building blocks you'll
; need to complete the original task: you have a function that returns a seq of
; coordinates and their xor values, you have a window you can draw into, and you
; know how to draw rectangles of different colors. Bear in mind that if you move
; the frame with the mouse, your beautiful graphics may disappear (depending on
; your OS and window manager). This is an artifact of this limited experiment
; and can be avoided using the full Java Swing capabilities.

; What's left to do? Use the graphics functions you just saw to draw the xor values:
(doseq [[x y xor] (xors 200 200)]
  (.setColor gfx (java.awt.Color. xor xor xor))
  (.fillRect gfx x y 1 1))

; The xors function you created earlier generates a seq of vectors, if you
; remember, where each vector has three elements: the x and y for your
; coordinates and the xor value that goes with them. The first line here uses
; destructuring to assign each of those three values to new locals x, y, and
; xor, respectively. The second line sets the "pen" color to a gray level based
; on the xor value, and the final line draws a single-pixel rectangle at the
; current coordinates.

; But just because you've succeeded doesn't mean you have to quit. You've built
; up some knowledge and a bit of a toolbox, so why not play with it a little?

; For example, the pattern appears to cut off in the middleâ€”perhaps you'd like
; to see more. Re-enter that last expression, but this time try larger limits:
(doseq [[x y xor] (xors 500 500)]
  (.setColor gfx (java.awt.Color. xor xor xor))
  (.fillRect gfx x y 1 1))

; IllegalArgumentException Color parameter outside of expected range: Green Blue
; java.awt.Color.testColorValueRange (Color.java:310)

; Whoops. Something went wrong, but what exactly? This gives you a perfect
; opportunity to try one final REPL tool. When an exception is thrown from
; something you try at the REPL, the result is stored in a var named *e. This
; allows you to get more detail about the expression, such as the stack trace:
(.printStackTrace *e)
; nil

; That's a lot of text, but don't panic. Learning to read Java stack traces is
; useful, so let's pick it apart. The first thing to understand is the overall
; structure of the trace -- there are two "causes." The original or root cause
; of the exception is listed last -- this is the best place to look first. The
; name and text of the exception there are the same as the REPL printed for you
; in the first place, although they won't always be. So let's look at that next
; line: at java.awt.Color.testColorValueRange(Color.java:310)

; Like most lines in the stack trace, this has four parts -- the name of the
; class, the name of the method, the filename, and finally the line number: at
; <class>.<method or constructor>(<filename>:<line>)

; In this case, the function name is testColorValueRange, which is defined in
; Java's own Color.java file. Unless this means more to you than it does to us,
; let's move on to the next line: at java.awt.Color.<init>(Color.java:382)

; It appears that it was the Color's constructor (called <init> in stack traces)
; that called the test function you saw earlier. So now the picture is pretty
; clear -- when you constructed a Color instance, it checked the values you
; passed in, decided they were invalid, and threw an appropriate exception.

; To fix your invalid Color argument, you can adjust the doseq form to return
; only produce legal values using the rem function, which returns the remainder
; so you can keep the results under 256:
(defn xors [xs ys]
  (for [x (range xs) y (range ys)]
    [x y (rem (bit-xor x y) 256)]))

; Note that you're redefining an existing function here. This is perfectly
; acceptable and well-supported behavior. Before moving on, create a function
; that takes a graphics object and clears it:
(defn clear [g] (.clearRect g 0 0 500 500))

; Calling (clear gfx) clears the frame, allowing the doseq form you tried before
; to work perfectly.
(clear gfx)

; Set the size to 500x500
(.setSize frame (java.awt.Dimension. 500 500))

; Redefine gfx to get a fresh reference now that the frame is 500x500
(def gfx (.getGraphics frame))

(doseq [[x y xor] (xors 500 500)]
  (.setColor gfx (java.awt.Color. xor xor xor))
  (.fillRect gfx x y 1 1))

; The bit-xor function does produce an interesting image, but it would be fun to
; explore what different functions look like. Try adding another parameter to
; xors so that you can pass in whatever function you'd like to look at. Because
; it's not just bit-xor anymore, change the name while you're at it:
(defn f-values [f xs ys]
  (for [x (range xs) y (range ys)]
    [x y (rem (f x y) 256)]))

; You might as well wrap your call to setSize, clear, and the doseq form in a
; function as well:
(defn draw-values [f xs ys]
  (clear gfx)
  (.setSize frame (java.awt.Dimension. xs ys))
  (doseq [[x y v] (f-values f xs ys)]
    (.setColor gfx (java.awt.Color. v v v))
    (.fillRect gfx x y 1 1)))

; This allows you to try different functions and ranges easily. Try to see what
; patterns emerge from the following:
(draw-values bit-xor 256 256)
(draw-values bit-and 256 256)
(draw-values + 256 256)
(draw-values * 500 500)
(draw-values (fn [x y] x) 256 256)
(draw-values (fn [x y] y) 256 256)
(draw-values (fn [x y] (int (/ (+ x y) 2))) 256 256)

; If this were the beginning or some awkward middle stage of a large project,
; you'd have succeeded in pushing past this troubling point and could now take
; the functions you've built and drop them into the larger project.

; By trying everything out at the REPL, you're encouraged to try smaller pieces
; rather than larger ones. The smaller the piece, the shorter the distance down
; an incorrect path you're likely to go. Not only does this reduce the overall
; development time, but it provides developers more frequent successes that can
; help keep morale and motivation high through even tough stages of a project.
; But trial-and-error exploration isn't enough. An intuitive basis in Clojure
; is also needed to become highly effective.
